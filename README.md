# GUI-Python-calculator
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @UpasnaAgrawal
I have created simple calculator in visual studio code.
The code starts by importing the tkinter library, which provides the necessary tools for creating GUI (graphical user interface) applications. 
It then creates a main window for the calculator using the Tk() function from the Tkinter library and assigns it to the variable root.
The root.title() function sets the title of the calculator window to â€œMy Calculator". 
Geometry() method is used to set the size of the GUI window. We have created display as where we can see the result area. 
I have added Basic Operators:Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication ,Division in my calculator.
